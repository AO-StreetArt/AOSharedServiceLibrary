This is a framework for constructing C++ Microservices.\r\nThis means smaller, more focused programs that perform a single function well and rely on inter-process\r\ncommunications.  \r\n\r\n### Why use AOSSL?\r\n\r\nOver the last twenty years, most enterprise scale applications have been built as 'monoliths', a single,\r\nlarge piece of software that must be deployed all at once.  This has a host of limitations, such as scalability\r\nand difficulty of highly-available systems.\r\n\r\nMicroservices offer a different design, instead relying on many different programs that all communicate\r\nin order to provide all of the services once provided by the monolithic application.  This lets us\r\nscale by starting up more instances of programs, and introduces a system with no single point of failure.\r\n\r\nThe AO Shared Service Library provides frameworks for microservices, ranging from communications protocols to\r\nuseful tools all services need.  This is meant to reduce time-to-market on C++ Services, and is designed\r\nto be reliable and robust while maintaining high performance standards.\r\n\r\nIt also provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing users to pick elements of the framework they would\r\nlike to use and exclude others.  This also promotes extensibility, as careful interface design allows for\r\nrapid development of new capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n#### Core Frameworks revolving around inter-service messaging protocols\r\n* HTTP Service Framework\r\n* ZeroMQ Service Framework\r\n\r\n#### Connections to Critical External Tools\r\n* Couchbase Administrator with cluster support\r\n* Redis Administrator\r\n* Consul Administrator\r\n\r\n#### Basic Tools that all good services need\r\n* Asynchronous Logging Module\r\n* Universally Unique ID Generator\r\n* A Command Line Argument Parser\r\n\r\n#### Platform Support\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 7, CentOS 7, RHEL 7\r\n* Easy to construct Docker Images with templates\r\n\r\nIn order to use the respective administrators, you should have an active [Consul] (https://www.consul.io/) Agent, as well as servers of [Couchbase] (http://www.couchbase.com/) and [Redis] (http://redis.io/) to connect to.\r\n\r\nFull API Documentation is available via doxygen, and the latest execution is stored in the docs/html folder.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n* [Quickstart] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/quickstart)\r\n* [Use] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use)\r\n* [Dependency Resolution] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/deps)\r\n* [Tests] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/tests)\r\n* [Building Documentation] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs)\r\n",
