# Callbacks

Request-based callbacks can be seen used the HTTP Server.  All callbacks match the following method signature:
    std::string process_request(struct Request *req)

The Request object has a few properties which are relevant:

* req_data - Used to store original request data
* req_addr - Used to store the request type
* req_err - A pointer used to store any error messages from the request
* resp_data - Used to store response data from the request

The Request Error, if present, will come in the form of:

    //! A struct that gets passed to callbacks to transmit errors
    struct RequestError
    {
      //! A numerical error code
      int err_code;

      //! An Error message
      std::string err_message;
      RequestError() {err_code = NOERROR; err_message = "";}
    };
