# How to Use the AO Shared Service Library

This page is meant to be an overview of functionality, for complete documentation see the [full API documentation generated by Doxygen] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/html).

## Service Component Factories

The Service Component Factories are components which allow us to build instances of the interfaces exposed by the library.

It's important that we use the factory to get instances of the interfaces as the interfaces guarantee backwards-compatibility.  While particular implementations may change,
the interfaces will remain the same across versions of the library.  For example:

    #include "include/factory_cli.h"
    #include "include/factory/commandline_interface.h"

    // Set up a Service Component Factory, where we get our application components
    CommandLineInterpreterFactory cli_factory;

The factory then provides us access to instances of the interfaces exposed by the library.

    CommandLineInterface *cli = cli_factory.get_command_line_interface( argc, argv );

Note: Be sure to delete anything you build with the factories!

## Choose a Framework

AOSSL Comes with two message-based frameworks which can be used to construct a microservice API: HTTP and Zero MQ.

It is not necessary to use one of the frameworks provided, as the tools included in the library will function with any other framework that is utilized.  Please note that neither the HTTP nor ZeroMQ Server should be called on different threads as they are not thread-safe.  The respective clients, however, are thread-safe.

### [HTTP Server] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/http_server)

#### [HTTP Interface] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/http_client)

### [ZeroMQ Sockets] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/zeromq)

## Tools

A Variety of tools are provided by AOSSL, all of which are thread safe.

### Connections to Critical External Tools

#### [Mongo Interface] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/mongo)

#### [Redis Interface] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/redis)

#### [Neo4j Interface] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/neo4j)

#### [Consul Interface] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/consul)

### Basic Tools

#### [Logging] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/logging)

#### [UUID Generation] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/uuid)

#### [Command Line Argument Parser] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/cli)

#### [Property File Reader] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/props)
