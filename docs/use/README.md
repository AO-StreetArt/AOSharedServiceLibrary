# How to Use the AO Shared Service Library

This page is meant to be an overview of functionality, for complete documentation see the [full API documentation generated by Doxygen] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/html).

## Core Components

### Service Component Factories

The Service Component Factories are components which allow us to build instances of the interfaces exposed by the library.

It's important that we use the factory to get instances of the interfaces as the interfaces guarantee backwards-compatibility.  While particular implementations may change,
the interfaces will remain the same across versions of the library.  For example:

    #include "include/factory_cli.h"
    #include "include/factory/commandline_interface.h"

    // Set up a Service Component Factory, where we get our application components
    CommandLineInterpreterFactory cli_factory;

The factory then provides us access to instances of the interfaces exposed by the library.

    CommandLineInterface *cli = cli_factory.get_command_line_interface( argc, argv );

Note: Be sure to delete anything you build with the factories!

### Callbacks

[Request-based callbacks] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use/drivers/callbacks) can be seen used with several AOSSL components, in particular the HTTP Server and Couchbase Administrator.
