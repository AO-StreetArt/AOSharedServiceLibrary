# Github Docs

The Github Documentation is divided into several sections, the easiest way to access this is from the [Home Page] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary).

# API Documentation

The API Documentation is generated using [Doxygen] (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html), and is available in the [html] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/html) folder here as well.

A Doxyfile is provided for those wishing to re-generate the docs.
