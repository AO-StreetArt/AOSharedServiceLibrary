# AO Shared Service Library Quick Start Guide

## Docker

The AO Shared Service Library is available as a docker image.  This allows developers to get a fully functional build environment with a single command, and offers a head-start on making production docker files.  Docker is the recommended method of deployment for Services, as it allows for easy horizontal scaling.

### Setup

Before we begin, we need to have a few things ready.

#### Installing Docker

If you do not already have Docker installed, please follow the instructions [here] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation).

### Running the Docker Image

You can create a fully functional build environment for new micro services via Docker, and ssh into that process.

`docker run --name aossl -d -P aostreetart/ao-services`

Then, you can access the container with the following:

`sudo docker exec -i -t aossl /bin/bash`

### Docker Images of External Tools

Docker images are also available for many/all of the external tools connected to within the library.

These are great tools for development, but you should follow the guidelines of each respective service when deploying to production.

#### Couchbase

In times when you need to connect to an instance of [Couchbase] (http://www.couchbase.com/), you can use the docker image (full instructions can be found [here] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/couchbase)).

`docker run -d --name db -p 8091-8093:8091-8093 -p 11210:11210 couchbase`

#### Redis

In times when you need to connect to an instance of [Redis] (http://redis.io/), you can use the docker image (full instructions can be found [here] (https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)).

`docker run --name some-redis -d redis`

#### Consul

In times when you need to connect to an instance of [Consul] (https://www.consul.io/), you can use the docker image (full instructions can be found [here] (https://hub.docker.com/_/consul/))

`docker run -d --name=dev-consul consul`

### Connecting from Docker Images

### Building the Docker Image

From the main project folder, we can execute the following command to build the docker image:

`docker pull aostreetart/aossl`
`docker build -t aostreetart/aossl .`
`docker push aostreetart/aossl`

## Build from Source

While Docker is a faster alternative, we can also build from source.  Note that this is currently only recommended on Unix systems due to OS-level dependencies.

### Setup

Before we begin, we need to build our dependencies and then build the project.

#### Dependencies

##### Ubuntu 14.04/Debian 7
The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.  Run the following commands from within the main folder

`mkdir ../aossl_deps`

`sudo cp scripts/deb/build_deps.sh ../aossl_deps`

`cd ../aossl_deps`

`sudo ./build_deps.sh`

##### CentOS 7/Redhat Enterprise Linux 7
The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.  Run the following commands from within the main folder

`mkdir ../aossl_deps`

`sudo cp scripts/rhel/build_deps.sh ../aossl_deps`

`cd ../aossl_deps`

`sudo ./build_deps.sh`

##### Other
Please refer to the [Dependency Resolution] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/deps) section of the documentation.

#### Build the Project

The project and tests can be built with make on most linux systems.

`make`

We can clean the build and remove all generated files with:

`make clean`

#### Build the Tests/Benchmarks

##### Ubuntu 14.04/Debian 7

Run the following to build the library test executables and the benchmarking apps

    make test
    make benchmarks

##### CentOS 7/Redhat Enterprise Linux 7

Run the following to build the library test executables and the benchmarking apps

    make rhel-test
    make rhel-benchmarks

#### Install and Uninstall the Project

The project can be installed on linux systems with:

`sudo make install`

We can uninstall the libraries with:

`sudo make uninstall`

## Use
Please continue on to the [Use] (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/use) section of the documentation to see example uses of the library.
