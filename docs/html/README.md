Welcome to the API Documentation for the AO Shared Service Library.

It is advised that you clone this repository at this point and view these html pages within a web browser, starting with html/index.html

The internal folder should be used by developers contributing to AOSSL only, as it contains documentation generated for internal implementation classes.  Services built on top of the library should implement interfaces and access them through the factory.
