\section*{Compiling your Application}

g++ is the recommended compiler for building applications using A\+O\+S\+SL, version 5.\+0 or greater.

\subsection*{Linking}

When linking your to A\+O\+S\+SL, you will also need to link to certain dependencies in many cases. In all cases, you will need to link to aossl directly\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-laossl
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{H\+T\+TP Administrator}

The H\+T\+TP Admin uses Curl, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lcurl
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{H\+T\+TP Server}

The H\+T\+TP Server relies on libevent, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-levent
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Consul Administrator}

The Consul Admin uses the H\+T\+TP Administrator, so you will need to link against curl here as well\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lcurl
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Logging}

For logging, we use the Log4\+Cpp module, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lpthread -llog4cpp
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{U\+U\+ID Generation}

The U\+U\+ID Generator uses libuuid, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-luuid
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Z\+MQ}

Zero\+MQ Communications utilize the Z\+MQ library and C++ bindings, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lzmq
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Redis}

Redis utilizes the hiredis library, which can be linked against with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lhiredis
\end{DoxyVerb}


If pkg-\/config is set up and libhiredis is installed correctly, we can also use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}`pkg-config --cflags --libs hiredis`
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Mongo}

Mongo utilizes both the Mongo C Driver libmongoc as well as libbson for json to bson conversions. \begin{DoxyVerb}-lmongoc-1.0 -lbson-1.0
\end{DoxyVerb}


When you use the default installers (included in the build\+\_\+deps scripts), the files for these libraries won\textquotesingle{}t be on your default include and linker paths. You may need to include the below directives to link against libmongo and libbson. \begin{DoxyVerb}-I/usr/include/libbson-1.0 -I/usr/local/include/libmongoc-1.0 -I/usr/local/include/libbson-1.0 -L/usr/local/lib
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Neo4j}

Neo4j depends on the Neo4j client, which needs to link against several dependencies\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-lneo4j-client -lssl -lcrypto -lm
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Standard}

AO Shared Service Library is coded to the c++11 standard. \begin{DoxyVerb}-std=c++11
\end{DoxyVerb}
