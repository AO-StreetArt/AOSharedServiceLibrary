\section*{Tests}

A\+O\+S\+SL Uses Travis-\/\+CI for automated builds and tests, for full history please see the \href{https://travis-ci.org/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary}{\tt Travis CI Homepage}.

\subsection*{Manually Executing Tests}

Once we follow the commands in the quickstart for building from source, we have a set of executables that end with \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} which run some basic tests on the libraries to ensure they function correctly. Please note that the Redis, Couchbase, Consul, and Mongo tests will require an active server/agent for the respective service. \begin{DoxyVerb}./cli_test name=test
./consul_test
./couchbase_test
./http_test
./logging_test
./redis_test
./uuid_test
./zmqio_test
./http_server_test
./mongo_test
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can hit the http\+\_\+server\+\_\+test with curl from the command line with\+: {\ttfamily curl -\/-\/request G\+ET \textquotesingle{}\href{http://0.0.0.0:12345/'}{\tt http\+://0.\+0.\+0.\+0\+:12345/\textquotesingle{}}}

\subsection*{Manually Executing Benchmarks}

We will also have a set of benchmark programs which are built on the \href{https://github.com/nickbruun/hayai}{\tt hayai} framework. These systematically test each element within the framework to provide realistic benchmarks on any given system. \begin{DoxyVerb}./consul_benchmark
./http_benchmark
./logging_benchmark
./redis_benchmark
./uuid_benchmark
./zmqio_benchmark
\end{DoxyVerb}


\section*{Where to Go From Here}
