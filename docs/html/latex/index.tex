Welcome to the AO Shared Service Library. This is a framework designed for constructing C++ Microservices. This means smaller, more focused programs that perform a single function well and rely on inter-\/process communications to perform complex tasks.

While designed with a Microservice architecture in mind, A\+O\+S\+SL also seeks to maintain enough flexibility to allow for use with any program architecture and any other libraries. A\+O\+S\+SL uses a plug-\/and-\/play architecture to allow users to pick and choose components they would like to use, and exclude others. This is meant to reduce time-\/to-\/market on C++ Services, and is designed to be easy to use and reliable, while maintaining high performance standards.
