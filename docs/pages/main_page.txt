 *
 * \section over Overview
 *
 * Welcome to the AO Shared Service Library.  This is a framework designed for constructing C++ Microservices.  This means smaller, more focused programs that perform a single function well and rely on inter-process communications to perform complex tasks.
 *
 * While designed with a Microservice architecture in mind, AOSSL also seeks to maintain enough flexibility to allow for use with any program architecture and any other libraries.  AOSSL uses a plug-and-play architecture to allow users to pick and choose components they would like to use, and exclude others.  This is meant to reduce time-to-market on C++ Services, and is designed to be easy to use and reliable, while maintaining high performance standards.
