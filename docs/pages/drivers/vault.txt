/*! \page vault Vault Interface
 *
 * The Hashicorp Vault is a solution for secrets storage, and this driver makes pulling secrets down from the vault easy.
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * We start by importing the necessary interfaces and establish the service factory.
 *
 *     #include "aossl/vault/include/factory_vault.h"
 *     #include "aossl/vault/include/vault_interface.h"
 *
 *     int main( int argc, char** argv )
 *     {
 *     AOSSL::VaultComponentFactory vault_factory;
 *     AOSSL::VaultInterface *vault = vault_factory.get_command_line_interface( argc, argv );
 *
 * We have access to an opt_exist method to determine if an option was entered, and we can use get_opt to pull parameter values.
 *
 *     if ( vault->opt_exist("name") ) {
 *       AOSSL::StringBuffer buf;
 *       vault->get_opt("name", buf);
 *       std::cout << buf.val << std::endl;
 *     }
 *
 *     return 0;
 *     }
 *
 * In addition, the method gen_ssl_cert can be used to call the Generate Certificate method
 * from the Vault PKI secrets engine.
 *
 *    AOSSL::SslCertificateBuffer buf;
 *    std::string role_name = "test";
 *    std::string common_name = "www.test.com";
 *    vault->gen_ssl_cert(role_name, common_name, buf);
 *
 * ## Multi-Threading
 *
 * The Vault Interface is threadsafe, and one instance can be shared across threads.
