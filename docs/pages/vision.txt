 * # Long Term Vision
 *
 * AOSSL was begun out of a need for blazing-fast, secure, and robust core services
 * within a larger architecture.  It looks to provide a developer kit which will decrease
 * overall time-to-market for these services, while allowing for maximum flexibility.
 *
 * The long-term vision of AOSSL is to provide the core elements of this framework,
 * while not encumbering developers with components they don't need.
 *
 * While the library previously contained a number of database drivers and messaging
 * frameworks, particular applications only needed some small number of these, and
 * not all of them packaged together.  As a result, these have either been split
 * out into separate libraries (https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/NeoCpp), or abandoned
 * in favor of existing drivers (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver).
 *
 * By keeping the data modules independent, we can use AOSSL to provide the core
 * components of a C++ Microservice (in the fashion of Spring Boot).  The first
 * piece of this that is available is automated configuration.
