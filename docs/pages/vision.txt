 * # Long Term Vision
 *
 * AOSSL was begun out of a need for blazing-fast, secure, and robust core services
 * within a larger architecture.  It looks to provide a developer kit which will decrease
 * overall time-to-market for these services, while allowing for maximum flexibility.
 *
 * The long-term vision of AOSSL is to ensure that this architecture is robust, secure,
 * and modular, and to continue to add functionality and drivers for major use-cases.
 * In addition, in future versions, AOSSL will look to become a full fledged framework,
 * rather than simply a collection of drivers.
