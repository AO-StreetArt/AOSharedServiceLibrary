/*! \page quickstart AOSSL Quick Start Guide
 *
 * ## Vagrant
 *
 * An AOSSL build environment can be created with Vagrant.  See \ref dev_notes "the Developer Notes" for more information.
 *
 * ## Use Latest Release
 *
 * Please see the [releases](https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/releases) page to download the latest release of the library.  Once downloaded, unpack the tar/zip file and cd into the main directory.  Then, run the following command:
 *
 *     sudo ./easy_install
 *
 * You will be prompted for your sudo password, after which the script will attempt to install all of the necessary dependencies, and then the library itself.  If you prefer, you can simply run:
 *
 *     sudo make install
 *
 * This will install the library without installing the dependencies.  You may execute the install dependencies script separately if desired via:
 *
 *     cd deps && sudo ./build_deps.sh
 *
 * Or, you may refer to the [Dependency Resolution](https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/deps) section of the documentation on how to install necessary dependencies manually.
 *
 * You may uninstall the library by executing:
 *
 *     sudo make uninstall
 *
 * ## Install the latest development versions
 *
 * Alternatively, you may clone the source from git directly and build the library yourself.  Note that this is currently only recommended on Unix systems due to OS-level dependencies.  Windows users should work with the Dockerfile provided.
 *
 * ### Setup
 *
 * Before we begin, we need to build our dependencies and then build the project.
 *
 * #### Dependencies
 *
 * ##### Ubuntu16.04/Debian 7
 * The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.  Run the following commands from within the main folder
 *
 *     mkdir ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     sudo cp scripts/deb/build_deps.sh ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     cd ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     sudo ./build_deps.sh
 *
 * ##### CentOS 7/Redhat Enterprise Linux 7
 * The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.
 *
 * Before using the script, you will need to ensure that you have gcc version 5 or greater installed (By default, CentOS comes with gcc 4.8):
 *
 *     gcc --version
 *
 * If you do not see version 5 or above, you can likely use the devtoolset to get the latest one:
 *
 *     sudo yum install centos-release-scl
 *     sudo yum install devtoolset-7-gcc*
 *     scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
 *     which gcc
 *     gcc --version
 *
 * Then, run the following commands from within the main folder to resolve the other dependencies
 *
 *     mkdir ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     sudo cp scripts/rhel/build_deps.sh ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     cd ../aossl_deps
 *
 *     sudo ./build_deps.sh
 *
 * ##### Other
 * Please refer to the [Dependency Resolution](https://github.com/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary/tree/master/docs/deps) section of the documentation.
 *
 * #### Build the Project
 *
 * The project and tests can be built with make on most linux systems.
 *
 *     make
 *
 * We can clean the build and remove all generated files with:
 *
 *     make clean
 *
 * #### Install and Uninstall the Project
 *
 * The project can be installed on linux systems with:
 *
 *     sudo make install
 *
 * We can uninstall the libraries with:
 *
 *     sudo make uninstall
 *
 * #### Build the Tests/Benchmarks
 *
 * Run the following to build the library test executables and the benchmarking apps
 *
 *     make tests
 *     make benchmarks
 *
 * ## Use
 * Please continue on to the \ref use_index "Use" section of the documentation to see example uses of the library.
