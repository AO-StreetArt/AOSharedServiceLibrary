 * # Developer Notes
 *
 * This page contains a series of notes intended to be beneficial for any contributors to AOSSL.
 *
 * ## Vagrant
 * We provide a Vagrantfile to setup a development environment, but this requires that you install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
 * Once you have Vagrant installed, cd into the main directory and run:
 *
 * `vagrant up`
 *
 * Once the box starts, you can enter it with:
 *
 * `vagrant ssh`
 *
 * The Project folder on your machine is synced to the /vagrant folder in the VM, so you will
 * need to move there before building.  Once in that folder, ensure that the tests pass:
 *
 * `make && make test`
 *
 * Make your changes and write tests for your changes, then ensure that all tests pass:
 *
 * `make clean && make && make test`
 *
 * Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
 *
 * ## Generating Releases
 *
 * The release_gen.sh script is utilized to generate releases for various systems.  It is run from within the scripts folder.
 * It accepts three command line arguments:
 * - the name of the release: aossl-*os_name*-*os_version*
 * - the version of the release: we follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
 * - the location of the dependency script: current valid paths are deb (uses apt-get) and rhel (uses yum)
