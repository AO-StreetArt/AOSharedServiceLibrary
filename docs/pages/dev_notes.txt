 * # Developer Notes
 *
 * This page contains a series of notes intended to be beneficial for any contributors to AOSSL.
 *
 * ## Generating Releases
 *
 * The release_gen.sh script is utilized to generate releases for various systems.  It is run from within the scripts folder.
 * It accepts three command line arguments:
 * - the name of the release: aossl-*os_name*-*os_version*
 * - the version of the release: we follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
 * - the location of the dependency script: current valid paths are deb (uses apt-get) and rhel (uses yum)
 *
 * ## Security Notes
 * Currently AOSSL components are unsecured.  Two security needs have been identified:
 * - Consul 'Secret Store' using Hashicorp Vault as a backend.  Allow for secure storage of private config values.
 * - Enabling HTTPS for the HTTP Client
