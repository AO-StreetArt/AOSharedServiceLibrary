 * # Developer Notes
 *
 * This page contains a series of notes intended to be beneficial for any contributors to AOSSL.
 *
 * ## Long Term Vision
 *
 * AOSSL was begun out of a need for blazing-fast, secure, and robust core services
 * within a larger architecture.  It looks to provide a developer kit which will decrease
 * overall time-to-market for these services, while allowing for maximum flexibility.
 *
 * The long-term vision of AOSSL is to ensure that this architecture is robust, secure,
 * and modular, and to continue to add functionality and drivers for major use-cases.
 * In addition, in future versions, AOSSL will look to become a full fledged framework,
 * rather than simply a collection of drivers.
 *
 * ## Generating Releases
 *
 * The release_gen.sh script is utilized to generate releases for various systems.
 * It accepts three command line arguments:
 * - the name of the release: aossl-*os_name*-*os_version*
 * - the version of the release: we follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
 * - the location of the dependency script: current valid paths are linux/deb (uses apt-get) and linux/rhel (uses yum)
