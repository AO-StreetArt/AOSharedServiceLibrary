 * # Dependency Resolution
 *
 * AOSSL has a number of different dependencies, as it includes a variety of different components.  Keep in mind that, if you don't want to build the entire library, you can make each subfolder in the aossl/ directory and install them independently.  In this case, you will only need to manually install dependencies for those components you wish to use.
 *
 * Please remember that a build_deps.sh script has been provided for Ubuntu/Debian/Redhat/CentOS.  If possible, you should try to utilize this script to perform the installation of the dependencies.
 * - [Rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) - Json Parsing
 *
 * We rely also on a set of base libraries which are installable via most package managers:
 * - libuuid (UUID Generator)
 *
 * You will need [Hayai](https://github.com/nickbruun/hayai) to run the benchmarks.
