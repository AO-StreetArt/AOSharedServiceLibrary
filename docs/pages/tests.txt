 *
 * # Tests
 *
 * AOSSL Uses Travis-CI for automated builds and tests, for full history please see the [Travis CI Homepage](https://travis-ci.org/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary).
 *
 * The current Travis configuration builds the central library, tests, and benchmarks.
 *
 * Then, Travis runs the specified tests.  If you are adding tests to the library, they will need to be added to the .travis.yml file in order to be run automatically.  It does not automatically run the benchmarks.
 *
 * # Where to Go From Here
 * Please continue on to the \ref dependencies "Dependencies" section of the documentation to see a discussion of the libraries dependencies for building on other operating systems.
