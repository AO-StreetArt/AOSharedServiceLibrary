 *
 * # Compiling your Application
 *
 * g++ is the recommended compiler for building applications using AOSSL, version 5.0 or greater.
 *
 * ## Linking
 * When linking your to AOSSL, you will also need to link to certain dependencies in many cases.  In all cases, you will need to link to aossl directly:
 *
 *     -laossl
 *
 * ### HTTP Administrator
 * The HTTP Admin uses Curl, which can be linked against with:
 *
 *     -lcurl
 *
 * ### Consul Administrator
 * The Consul Admin uses the HTTP Administrator, so you will need to link against curl here as well:
 *
 *     -lcurl
 *
 * ### UUID Generation
 * The UUID Generator uses libuuid, which can be linked against with:
 *
 *     -luuid
 *
