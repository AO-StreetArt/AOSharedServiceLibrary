# AO Shared Service Library

![](https://travis-ci.org/AO-StreetArt/AOSharedServiceLibrary.svg?branch=master)

## Overview

Welcome to the AO Shared Service Library.  This is a framework designed for constructing C++ Microservices.
This means smaller, more focused programs that perform a single function well and rely on inter-process
communications to perform complex tasks.  

While designed with a Microservice architecture in mind, AOSSL also seeks to maintain enough flexibility to allow for use with any program architecture and any other libraries.  AOSSL uses a plug-and-play architecture to allow users to pick and choose components they would like to use, and exclude others.  This is meant to reduce time-to-market on C++ Services, and is designed to be easy to use and reliable, while maintaining high performance standards.

### Features:
#### Core Frameworks revolving around inter-service messaging protocols
* HTTP Service Framework
* ZeroMQ Service Framework

#### Connections to Critical External Tools

* Mongo Interface
* Redis Interface
* Consul Interface
* Neo4j Interface

#### Basic Tools
* Asynchronous Logging Module
* Universally Unique ID Generator
* Command Line Argument Parser
* Properties File Parser

#### Platform Support
* Support for Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 7, Debian 8, CentOS 7, RHEL 7
* Easy to construct Docker Images with templates
