In this folder you can find the licenses for all dependencies of AOSSL.

While this is not necessarily required, we list all of these licenses in an effort to give due credit to those people who dedicated their time to creating all of the code that AOSSL is built upon.

Please note that no code from any of these libraries has been included within AOSSL (although a script to install specific versions is included).  You are expected to link against these dependencies separately when compiling your application.

If you find that any license requirements have been violated, please raise an issue on the github repository and it will be addressed immediately.
