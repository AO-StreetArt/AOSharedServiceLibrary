In this folder you can find the licenses for all dependencies of AOSSL.

While this is not necessarily required, we list all of these licenses in an effort to give due credit to those people who dedicated their time to creating all of the code that AOSSL is built upon.

Please note that no code from any of these libraries has been included within AOSSL.  You are expected to link against these dependencies separately when compiling your application.
